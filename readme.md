# Advanced ML-Driven Algorithmic Trading System

## Overview
This project implements a sophisticated algorithmic trading system leveraging machine learning techniques, comprehensive data pipelines, and robust risk management strategies. The system is designed to process multiple data sources, generate advanced trading signals, and execute trades while maintaining strict risk controls.

## Key Features
- Comprehensive data pipeline with multiple data sources integration
- Advanced feature engineering and preprocessing
- Ensemble ML architecture combining multiple models
- Sophisticated risk management system
- Production-grade infrastructure with real-time capabilities

## System Requirements
- Python 3.8+
- TimescaleDB/InfluxDB for time-series data storage
- Redis for real-time data caching
- Required Python packages (to be listed in requirements.txt)

## Project Structure
The project follows a modular architecture with the following main components:
1. Data Pipeline
2. Feature Engineering
3. ML Models
4. Risk Management
5. Production Infrastructure
